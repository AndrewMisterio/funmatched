# Naruto universe
When in game only Naruto's characters add next rules:
- Elements: Some attack and defense cards belong to one of the elements (marked with a symbol). There are 5 elements: fire, wind, lightning, earth, and water. If the element of the attacking card is superior to the element of the defending card, the defense is reduced by 2.
Fire trumps wind, wind trumps lightning, lightning trumps earth, earth trumps water, water trumps fire.
